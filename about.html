            <h2>Our Founder: Dr. Sunil Kukreja</h2>
            <p>AetherVision is led by Dr. Sunil Kukreja, a visionary senior executive and service-disabled veteran (U.S. Air Force & Army) with over 20 years of experience leading high-impact R&D in defense, aerospace, and federal sectors. With a Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from McGill University and significant leadership roles at Raytheon Technologies Research Center (RTRC), NASA, and the National University of Singapore (NUS), Dr. Kukreja brings a unique blend of deep technical proficiency and strategic leadership.</p>
            <p>His expertise spans AI/ML, robotics, autonomous systems, neuromorphic engineering, sensor fusion, systems engineering (MBSE), and cybersecurity. At RTRC, Dr. Kukreja spearheaded critical initiatives, including leading the successful execution of the high-impact DARPA FENCE program ($5.5M funding, TRL-6 prototype delivery exceeding milestones). His leadership extended to architecting secure cloud systems (AWS GovCloud) for multi-INT ISR data analysis, directing AI-powered robotic inspection systems achieving significant cost savings and safety improvements, and overseeing complex DoD program portfolios involving AI/ML platforms for autonomous systems. This included managing large multidisciplinary teams, implementing robust technical oversight adhering to ITAR and cybersecurity standards (NIST/RMF), driving Agile transformations, adopting Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and cloud automation across major platforms (AWS/Azure/GCP), and ensuring rigorous risk management (FMEA) and safety assurance for high-consequence operations.</p>
            <p>Prior to his industry leadership, Dr. Kukreja made significant contributions at NASA, leading teams developing critical AI/ML models for flight safety (F/A-18 flutter prediction) and astronaut health monitoring, establishing gold-standard data governance frameworks, and championing MBSE adoption. At NUS, he built and directed a world-renowned Neuromorphic Engineering & Robotics research center, securing substantial funding ($10M+) and leading advancements in areas like neuromorphic tactile sensing and cognitive load analysis for high-stress environments.</p>
            <p>Dr. Kukreja's career demonstrates a consistent ability to manage complex technical programs, lead large teams, secure funding, deliver cutting-edge technology, and foster cultures of technical excellence, safety, and inclusion with a strong commitment to mentoring and veteran hiring.</p>
