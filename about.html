            <h2>Founder's Expertise: Dr. Sunil Kukreja, Ph.D.</h2>
            <p>AetherVision was founded by Dr. Sunil Kukreja, a U.S. Veteran (Air Force & Army, Honorable Discharge) whose career embodies a unique convergence of military service, advanced academic research, and high-impact technology development within the defense and aerospace sectors. His experience spans critical roles at NASA, Raytheon Technologies Research Center, and the National University of Singapore (NUS), providing him with unparalleled multi-domain expertise.</p>
            <p>At NASA, Dr. Kukreja served as a Senior Principal Research Scientist, leading research programs focused on astronaut health, advanced control systems for high-performance aircraft (like the F/A-18), and pioneering AI/ML applications for predictive modeling and system analysis, contributing significantly to mission safety and effectiveness.</p>
            <p>During his tenure as Associate Director of AI, Machine Learning, and Robotics at Raytheon Technologies Research Center, Dr. Kukreja conceptualized, pitched, led, and executed critical programs for DARPA and other DoD agencies. This included leadership of the highly successful $5.5M FENCE program (Fast Event-driven Neuromorphic Camera for Enhanced situational awareness), which exceeded all milestones and delivered a TRL-6 prototype demonstrating revolutionary neuromorphic vision capabilities for threat detection with significant improvements in sensitivity, false alarm reduction, and power efficiency. His work consistently involved developing secure, AI-powered systems for ISR, autonomous robotics, predictive maintenance, and multi-swarm autonomy, often managing large, geographically dispersed teams and complex budgets.</p>
             <p>As an Associate Professor and Director of Neuromorphic Engineering & Robotics at NUS, Dr. Kukreja built and led a world-renowned research team, securing $10 million in competitive funding. His research drove significant advancements in surgical robotics (achieving a 40% increase in precision for a novel platform), AI-powered medical devices, neuromorphic sensing, and human performance analysis, resulting in numerous high-impact publications and patents.</p>
            <p>Dr. Kukreja's deep technical expertise encompasses AI/ML, neuromorphic computing, event-based sensing, robotics, ISR platforms, sensor fusion, advanced algorithms, secure cloud architectures, and edge computing. His proven ability to secure funding, lead complex programs (up to $60M), drive innovation from concept to deployment, and navigate demanding technical and regulatory landscapes forms the bedrock of AetherVision's capabilities. His commitment extends to fostering diversity and mentoring the next generation of engineers and scientists.</p>
