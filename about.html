            <h2 id="founder-bio-heading">Our Founder: Dr. Sunil Kukreja – Visionary Leadership, Proven Results</h2>
            <p>AetherVision is led by its founder, Dr. Sunil Kukreja, a highly accomplished senior executive, Ph.D. biomedical engineer, and service-disabled veteran of both the U.S. Air Force & U.S. Army. With over 20 years of impactful experience spearheading high-consequence research and development programs across the defense, aerospace, and federal sectors, Dr. Kukreja brings a rare combination of deep technical mastery and proven strategic leadership to the company.</p>
            <p><strong>Prior Leadership Experience:</strong> Before establishing AetherVision, Dr. Kukreja held significant roles demonstrating his ability to deliver results in complex environments. As Associate Director of AI, Machine Learning, and Robotics at <strong>Raytheon Technologies Research Center (RTRC)</strong>, he managed large, mission-critical DoD program portfolios (valued at <strong>$60M+</strong> annually) focused on AI/ML platforms for autonomous systems and advanced sensing. Notably, he <strong>conceptualized, successfully pitched to DARPA, led the internal technical council approval process influencing the BAA release, and subsequently directed the high-impact $5.5M DARPA FENCE program execution</strong>. This effort exceeded all technical milestones (average <strong>20%</strong> margin) and delivered a <strong>TRL-6</strong> neuromorphic camera prototype, demonstrably reducing operator cognitive load (by <strong>30%</strong>) and significantly enhancing sensitivity (<strong>60%</strong> improvement). His tenure at RTRC included managing large multidisciplinary teams (up to <strong>87 personnel</strong>, achieving <strong>95%</strong> employee satisfaction), overseeing Profit & Loss (P&L) for substantial engineering budgets, architecting secure cloud systems (AWS GovCloud, Azure Government) for multi-INT ISR data analysis, and directing AI-powered robotic inspection systems that realized significant cost savings (<strong>$15-20M annually</strong>). He implemented robust technical oversight adhering to ITAR and cybersecurity standards (NIST/RMF), drove successful Agile transformations (Scrum/Kanban) resulting in significantly reduced development cycles (e.g., <strong>35% reduction</strong>) and increased team velocity (<strong>20% increase</strong>), championed Infrastructure as Code (IaC using Terraform) for scalable cloud deployments (achieving <strong>30% reduction</strong> in provisioning time), and ensured rigorous risk management (FMEA) for high-consequence operations. His leadership consistently resulted in on-time, on-budget delivery (<strong>100%</strong> on managed $60M portfolio), exceeding customer expectations (<strong>90%+</strong>) and securing follow-on contracts.</p>
            <p>As a Senior Principal Research Scientist at <strong>NASA</strong>, Dr. Kukreja led teams developing critical AI/ML models for flight safety, including F/A-18 flutter prediction systems that achieved a <strong>100% success rate</strong> in preventing flutter incidents in tests and improved control effectiveness by <strong>15-20%</strong>. He also contributed to astronaut health monitoring systems, improving predictive accuracy by <strong>25%</strong>. He established gold-standard data governance frameworks for sensitive astronaut data (achieving <strong>100% compliance</strong> and <strong>zero breaches</strong>) and championed the adoption of Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), significantly increasing divisional capability (<strong>40% increase</strong>).</p>
            <p>Prior to his industry and government roles, Dr. Kukreja directed a world-renowned Neuromorphic Engineering & Robotics research center at the <strong>National University of Singapore (NUS)</strong>. There, he secured over <strong>$10 million</strong> in competitive international funding (including ONR Global) and led pioneering advancements in neuromorphic tactile sensing (achieving <strong>100x</strong> density, <strong>90%</strong> power reduction in prior NUS work), surgical robotics (achieving <strong>40% increase</strong> in precision), and cognitive performance analysis (improving accuracy by <strong>25%</strong>).</p>
            <p>Dr. Kukreja's career is marked by an exceptional ability to manage complex technical programs from concept to delivery, lead large, diverse teams effectively, secure significant funding (over <strong>$30M+</strong> in competitive research grants throughout career), deliver cutting-edge technology resulting in tangible impact (<strong>7+ patents</strong> filed/granted, <strong>100+ publications</strong>), foster cultures of technical excellence and inclusion, and maintain a strong commitment to mentoring (<strong>65+</strong> individuals) and veteran hiring. His extensive technical expertise spans AI/ML, robotics, autonomous systems, neuromorphic engineering, sensor fusion, systems engineering (MBSE), secure cloud computing (AWS/Azure/GCP), edge computing, cybersecurity (NIST/RMF/CMMC principles), and data governance.</p>
