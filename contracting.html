            <h2>SDVOSB Certified Partner for Mission-Critical Solutions</h2>
            <p>AetherVision LLC is a formally verified Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), deeply committed to addressing the critical mission requirements of the U.S. Government, particularly the Department of Defense and the Intelligence Community. Our SDVOSB status enables government agencies to partner with us efficiently through dedicated set-aside contracts and potentially through sole-source acquisitions, facilitating rapid access to our unique technological innovations and specialized expertise.</p>
            <p>We are registered in the System for Award Management (SAM.gov) and are actively pursuing opportunities where our distinct capabilities provide significant value. Our unique qualifications—including pioneering work in neuromorphic sensing exemplified by the successful execution and TRL-6 prototype delivery for the **DARPA FENCE program**, coupled with the founder's specific multi-domain leadership experience across defense R&D (Raytheon, NASA) and advanced AI/ML applications—may provide justification for sole-source considerations under FAR Part 19.1406 when specific, urgent, or highly specialized requirements necessitate our unique technical approach or expertise.</p>
